# Video Page Enhancement Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Last Watched Video Redirect
When users navigate to `/app/video` (from the menu), they are automatically redirected to the last video they were watching.

#### Logic for Determining Last Watched Video:
1. **Priority 1**: Lesson with highest progress that isn't completed (user was actively watching)
2. **Priority 2**: First incomplete lesson (if no progress exists)
3. **Priority 3**: Last lesson (if all lessons are completed)
4. **Fallback**: First lesson (if all else fails)

#### Implementation:
- **New Route**: Added `/app/video` route that uses `VideoRedirect` component
- **VideoRedirect Component**: Handles the redirect logic based on user progress
- **Enhanced useCourse Hook**: Added `getLastWatchedLesson()` function with smart detection
- **Updated Sidebar**: Menu now links to `/app/video` instead of `/app/video/1`

### 2. Green Background for Completed Lessons
Videos that have been completed now display with a green background theme.

#### Visual Changes:
- **Background**: Green.50 (light green) instead of white
- **Border**: Green.200 instead of gray.100
- **Enhanced Badge**: More prominent completion badge with better styling

## Files Modified

### 1. useCourse.jsx
```javascript
// Added new function
const getLastWatchedLesson = () => {
  // Smart logic to determine the best lesson to resume
}

// Enhanced context provider
<CourseContext.Provider value={{
  // ...existing values
  getLastWatchedLesson,
  getCurrentOrNextLesson,
}}>
```

### 2. VideoRedirect.jsx (New Component)
```javascript
// Handles automatic redirect to last watched lesson
const VideoRedirect = () => {
  // Waits for data to load, then redirects to appropriate lesson
}
```

### 3. App.jsx

// Added new route
<Route path="video" element={<VideoRedirect />} />
<Route path="video/:lessonId" element={<VideoPlayer />} />
```

### 4. VideoPlayer.jsx
```javascript
// Added conditional styling for completed lessons
<Box
  bg={lesson.completed ? "green.50" : "white"}
  borderColor={lesson.completed ? "green.200" : "gray.100"}
>

// Enhanced completion badge
<Badge 
  colorScheme="green" 
  variant="solid"
  px={3}
  py={1}
  borderRadius="full"
>
```

### 5. Sidebar.jsx

// Updated Video menu link
{ name: 'Video', href: '/app/video', icon: FaVideo }
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before:
1. User clicks "Video" in menu → Always goes to lesson 1
2. Completed lessons looked the same as incomplete ones

### After:
1. User clicks "Video" in menu → Goes to last watched/appropriate lesson
2. Completed lessons have green background and enhanced styling
3. Smart detection picks the most relevant lesson to resume

## Smart Lesson Detection Examples

**Scenario 1**: User watched lesson 3 to 45%, lesson 5 to 20%
- **Result**: Opens lesson 3 (highest progress, not completed)

**Scenario 2**: User completed lessons 1-5, watched lesson 6 to 30%
- **Result**: Opens lesson 6 (next incomplete with progress)

**Scenario 3**: User completed all lessons
- **Result**: Opens last lesson (lesson 32)

**Scenario 4**: New user, no progress
- **Result**: Opens lesson 1 (first lesson)

## Benefits

✅ **Seamless Resume**: Users continue where they left off  
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of completed content  
✅ **Smart Navigation**: Intelligent lesson selection based on progress  
✅ **Better UX**: No need to remember which lesson to watch next  
✅ **Progress Awareness**: Green styling reinforces sense of achievement  

The video page now provides a much more intuitive and user-friendly experience!

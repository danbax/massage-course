# Progress Data Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The API response structure was incorrectly assumed to have a nested `data` property. The actual response object directly contains the data with properties: `course_progress`, `modules`, and `completion_timeline`.

## Changes Made
1. **useCourse.jsx - loadProgress function**: Removed destructuring of `{ data } = response` and used `response` directly
2. **useCourse.jsx - refreshProgress function**: Fixed the same destructuring issue
3. **Removed debug logs**: Cleaned up console.log statements used for debugging

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Progress data should load correctly from the backend API
- Lesson completion status should be reflected in the UI
- Watch progress percentages should display correctly
- The Progress page should show actual progress from the server
- After marking a lesson complete, the progress should refresh and update

## API Response Structure
```json
{
  "course_progress": { ... },
  "modules": [
    {
      "lessons": [
        {
          "progress": {
            "watch_percentage": "100.00",
            "is_completed": true,
            ...
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "completion_timeline": [ ... ]
}
```

## Test Steps
1. Navigate to the course progress page
2. Verify that lessons show completion status and watch percentages
3. Mark a lesson as complete
4. Verify that the UI updates to reflect the completion
5. Refresh the page and verify progress persists
